# Meteorite-Landings-Analysis-
To learn the process of data cleaning, we will use NASA's meteorite landings dataset
The Meteoritical Society (link provided in the Activities section) collects data on meteorites that have fallen to Earth from outer space. The dataset contains the following variables for over 45,000 meteorites that have struck our planet.
This dataset was downloaded from NASA's Data Portal and is based on The Meteoritical Society's Meteoritical Bulletin Database 
Step-0:  Import Necessary Libraries 
Step-1:  Loading The Dataset
            Let's create a DataFrame for the meteorite landings dataset. Here's the link to the CSV file (don't click on it): 
                          "https://student-datasets-bucket.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/whitehat-ds-datasets/meteorite-landings/meteorite-landings.csv"
Step-2: Create Tuples 
            Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.Tuples are written with round brackets.
Step- 3: The describe() Function 
Step-4: The Boxplot
